<h1>Battle of the Neighborhoods!</h1>

<h2>Introduction/Business Problem</h2>
This project attempts to map out, segment and explore the neighborhoods in the city of Calgary. The goal will be to help entrepreneurs and prospective business owners decide optimum locations to start a new business. Several factors will govern location selection such as the type of business, target customer base, proximity to public transit and size of physical store, to name a few.

<h2>Data Used</h2>
A number of tools and datasets will be exploited to tackle the subject. Foursquare location data will be the main API server leveraged to extract geospatial information (latitude and longitude) of the neighborhoods across Calgary and to explore the different venues and types of businesses that currently exist in those neighborhoods. In addition, a comprehensive <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Calgary#List>list</a> showing the breakdown of the neighborhoods, their physical size, and population will be scraped and structured to be included in the analysis.
